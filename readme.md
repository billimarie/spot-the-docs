# Spot the Docs

For the [#100DaysofCode challenge](https://github.com/billimarie/100-days-of-code), I'm working on a lightweight Laravel/Heroku web app that shows you which open source projects need documentation help.

## Demo

See **Spot the Docs** live on [Heroku](https://floating-citadel-84168.herokuapp.com).

## Documentation

For installation, contributor guidelines, deployment, and FAQs: [Spot the Docs (MkDocs)](https://billimarie.github.io/spot-the-docs)

## Contributing

**Spot the Docs** is still trying to hatch. If you'd like to contribute, feel free!

## License

**Spot the Docs** is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Note

The [Spot the Docs](http://floating-citadel-84168.herokuapp.com) title is a riff on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/).

...the unfortunate side-effect of this awesome rhyme include its awkward acronym ('StD').
