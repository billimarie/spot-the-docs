# Spot the Docs

For the [#100DaysofCode challenge](https://github.com/billimarie/100-days-of-code), I'm working on a lightweight Laravel web app that shows you which open source projects need documentation help.

View it live on [Heroku](https://floating-citadel-84168.herokuapp.com/github).

## Documentation

Coincidentally coming soon. Or later. Eventually, definitely.

## Contributing

Spot the Docs is still trying to hatch. If you'd like to contribute, feel free!

Thank you for considering contributing to the Laravel framework! The contribution guide can be found in the [Laravel documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/contributions).

### Note

The Spot the Docs title is a riff on ReadTheDocs and WriteTheDocs. The unfortunate side-effect of the awesome rhyme is its awkward acronym ('StD').
